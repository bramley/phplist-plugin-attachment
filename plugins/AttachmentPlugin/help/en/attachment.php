Each row refers to a file that is attached, or has been attached, to a message. If a file is detached from a message, phplist does not remove the row from the attachment table nor delete the file from the file system. </p><p>It is safe to delete rows from the attachment table that refer to files that are no longer attached to messages, and to delete the files from the file system. If you attach the same file again then phplist will create a new row in the attachment table; it does not re-use an existing row.</p><p>When attaching a file to a message phplist copies the file and renames it by adding a suffix. A 0-byte length file with that new name and an empty file extension is also created.</p><table><tr><td>Repository</td><td>The location of the attachment repository, from config.php.</td></tr><tr><td>ID</td><td>The ID of the row in the attachment table.</td></tr><tr><td>File</td><td>The name of the file in the attachment repository directory.</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td>The description added when the file was attached to a message.</td></tr><tr><td>Message</td><td>The ID of the message to which the file is attached.
